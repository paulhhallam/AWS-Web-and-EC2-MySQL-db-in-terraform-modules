AWS Web and EC2 MySQL db in terraform modules

This is an example of a set of terraform templates in module form to create the network 
infrastructure and nodes for a Public Web server accessing a private EC2 MySQL database.

The main point of this exercise was to demonstrate the use of variables and how to pass them in and out of terraform modules.

The cost of this infrastructure is measured in single dollars, especially when almost immediately destroyed.
